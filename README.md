### Description:
#### This is a standalone tool for frequency domain data analysis with the following features: 
```tex
1. Data Pre-processing: High Pass Filter to remove gravity component DC offset of accelerometer sensor data
2. Data Pre-processing: Fast Fourier Transform to transform time series sensor data into discrete frequency components
3. Feature Engineering: Extraction of insightful frequency domain features of PD gestures using statistical tools (e.g.: mean, std, iqr, skewness, kurtosis) 
4. Data Visualisation: Visualisation of frequency domain features against different levels of UPDRS rating PD severity
```
